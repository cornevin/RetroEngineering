# RetroEngineering


This project is composed in two parts. This project is a maven project to be easier to import. If you want to build the
plugin and the core of the application just write : mvn clean install in the root of the folder.

The first part is the LMU core project which contains all the functionality of the plugin.

The second part contain the plugin himself.
